### How To Use üîß

From your command line, first clone the project:

```bash
# Clone the project
$ git clone "https://github.com/mibrahimbashir/customer_reviews.git"

# Go into the project level repository
$ cd customer_reviews

# Install dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# Go into the spider repository
$ cd customer_reviews

# Run the spider
$ scrapy crawl tp

```


Executing the above commands will start the Scrapy spider, which will collect customer reviews and save them in two files: `reviews.csv` and `reviews.json`.

To stop execution, press <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd> inside the command line OR equivalently close the application.

#### Additional Configurations

If you want to attach new *Browser Headers* with each request, head over to the [ScrapeOps](https://scrapeops.io/) website and create a free account. Once signed up a free **API KEY** will be created for your account. 

Create a new `.env` file in the project directory and paste the following line of code in it. Make sure the file name exactly matches `.env`. Once done, save the file and you are good to go. 

```python

SCRAPEOPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
